# magic-hat

Magic Hat is a tool written in Python used to manipulate arrays of strings using pseudorandom numbers.

# Using Magic Hat

1. Start the Magic Hat by:
	A. Cloning the repository
	B. Navigating to /magic-hat/src
	C. Running the command 'python hat.py'

2. Tell the Magic Hat what you would like to place inside. A good example would be fruits. I might say "apple pear orange"

3. The Magic Hat will then ask you what you would like it to do with the inputs. You may ask for the fruits in a random order, select one fruit at random, or create random pairs of fruits (note: if you do not have an even number of inputs, Magic Hat will add an input called 'Bye' so that every element has a pair)
